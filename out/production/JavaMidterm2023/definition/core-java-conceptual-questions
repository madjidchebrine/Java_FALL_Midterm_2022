What is a class in Java?
-A class in Java is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that define the properties and methods of an object.
What is an object in Java?
-An object in Java is an instance of a class that has its own state and behavior.
What is an interface in Java?
-An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods that define a set of actions or behaviors that a class can implement.
What is a constructor in Java?
-A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object is created and is used to initialize the object's state.
What is the difference between a constructor and a method in Java?
-A constructor is used to create and initialize an object, while a method is used to perform an action or a behavior on an object.
What is the purpose of the main method in Java?
-The purpose of the main method in Java is to serve as the entry point for a Java program and to execute the program's code.
What is inheritance in Java?
-Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where a new class is created from an existing class and inherits the properties and methods of the existing class.
What is polymorphism in Java?
-Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms and to respond differently to the same method call.
What is encapsulation in Java?
-Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism that binds data and methods that manipulate the data, preventing unauthorized access to the data.
What is abstraction in Java?
-Abstraction in Java is a mechanism that hides the implementation details of a class and provides a simplified interface for the user to interact with the class.
What is a package in Java?
-A package in Java is a collection of related classes and interfaces that are grouped together.
What is a final keyword in Java?
-The final keyword in Java is used to make a variable, method, or class constant and unchangeable.
What is an abstract class in Java?
-An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed.
What is a concrete class in Java?
-a correct class is a class that can be  instantiated or created into an object.
What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java?
-A concrete class in Java is a class that can be instantiated and is meant to be used to create objects.
What is a thread in Java?
-A thread in Java is a lightweight sub-process that can execute concurrently with other threads within the same process, sharing the same memory and resources.
What is the difference between a thread and a process in Java?
- in Java is that a process is a separate execution environment with its own memory space, whereas a thread shares the same memory space as the parent process and other threads
What is a synchronized keyword in Java?
-The synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutual exclusion and ensure that only one thread can access a block of code or a method at a time.
What is a volatile keyword in Java?
-The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads, and ensures that any changes to the variable's value are immediately visible to all threads.
What is the difference between an array and an ArrayList in Java?
-An array in Java is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, while an ArrayList is a dynamic-size collection of elements that can grow or shrink as needed.
What is a HashMap in Java?
-A HashMap in Java is a collection that stores key-value pairs and uses hashing to quickly retrieve values based on their keys.
What is a HashSet in Java?
-A HashSet in Java is a collection that stores unique elements and uses hashing to provide constant-time performance for add, remove, and contains operations.
What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList in Java?
-An ArrayList in Java is implemented as an array, while a LinkedList is implemented as a doubly linked list, and provides faster insertion and deletion operations but slower access times.
What is a stack in Java?
-A stack in Java is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that supports push and pop operations.
What is a queue in Java?
-A queue in Java is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that supports enqueue and dequeue operations.
What is a binary tree in Java?
-A binary tree in Java is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree in Java?
-A binary search tree in Java is a binary tree in which the left subtree of each node contains only values that are less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only values that are greater.
What is the difference between an abstract class and a concrete class in Java?
-An abstract class in Java cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed, while a concrete class can be instantiated and used to create objects.
What is the difference between a private and a protected keyword in Java?
-A private keyword in Java is used to restrict access to a method or variable to only the class in which it is declared, while a protected keyword allows access to the method or variable within the same package or through subclassing.
What is the difference between a break and a continue statement in Java?
-A break statement in Java is used to exit a loop or switch statement, while a continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.
What is the difference between a final and a finally keyword in Java?
-The final keyword in Java is used to make a variable, method, or class constant and unchangeable, while the finally keyword is used in a try-catch-finally block to ensure that a section of code is always executed.
What is the difference between a throw and a throws keyword in Java?
-The throw keyword is used to manually throw an exception in Java, while the throws keyword is used to declare that a method may throw a particular type of exception.
What is the difference between an exception and an error in Java?
-Exceptions in Java are runtime errors that can be caught and handled by the program, while errors are serious issues that cannot be handled and often result in program termination.
What is a checked and an unchecked exception in Java?
-Checked exceptions in Java are exceptions that must be handled or declared in the method signature, while unchecked exceptions are not required to be handled or declared.
What is the difference between a RuntimeException and an Exception in Java?
-A RuntimeException in Java is an unchecked exception that can occur at runtime and does not need to be explicitly handled or declared, while an Exception is a checked exception that must be handled or declared.
What is the difference between a static and a non-static method in Java?
-A static method in Java belongs to the class and can be called without creating an instance of the class, while a non-static method belongs to an instance of the class and can only be called through an instance of the class.
What is the difference between an instance variable and a static variable in Java?
-An instance variable in Java belongs to an instance of the class and has a separate value for each instance, while a static variable belongs to the class and has a single value for all instances.
What is the difference between a public and a private method in Java?
-Public methods can be accessed from anywhere in the program, while private methods can only be accessed within the class they are defined in.
What is the difference between an int and a long data type in Java?
-int is a 32-bit data type, while long is a 64-bit data type.
What is the difference between a float and a double data type in Java?
-float is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point data type, while double is a 64-bit double-precision floating-point data type.
What is the difference between a while and a do-while loop in Java?
-A while loop checks the condition before executing the loop, while a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop at least once.
What is the difference between a for and a foreach loop in Java?
-A for loop is used to iterate a fixed number of times, while a foreach loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array or collection.
What is the difference between a switch and an if-else statement in Java?
-A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and execute different code blocks depending on the value of the expression, while an if-else statement allows a program to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false.
What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block in Java?
-A synchronized method synchronizes the entire method, while a synchronized block synchronizes a portion of the code within the block.
What is the difference between a join and a sleep method in Java?
-The join() method is used to wait for a thread to complete execution before moving on to the next statement, while the sleep() method is used to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified amount of time.
